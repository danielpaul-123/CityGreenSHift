        <h1>Solar Energy</h1>
        <h4>Introduction:</h4>
        <p class="bd">In the quest for sustainable and clean energy solutions, solar power has emerged as a frontrunner. The utilization of solar energy involves capturing the radiant light and heat emitted by the sun and converting it into electricity. This renewable energy source offers a plethora of advantages, from environmental benefits to economic advantages. This article explores the various facets of solar energy, its connection to sustainability, and provides insights into how individuals and communities can transition to solar power.</p>
        <h4>Understanding Solar Energy</h4>
        <p class="bd">Solar energy is harnessed through the use of photovoltaic cells, commonly known as solar cells, which convert sunlight into electricity. These cells are often made of semiconductors like silicon. When sunlight strikes the cells, it excites the electrons, creating an electric current. This direct current (DC) is then converted into alternating current (AC) through an inverter, making it suitable for use in homes, businesses, and the electric grid.</p>
